# Smart-Garage-System-
Welcome to the Smart Garage System repository! This project utilizes FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) technology and VHDL  to create an intelligent garage management system. The system is designed to automate and enhance various aspects of garage operations, including vehicle detection, monitoring, and control.

Features
Vehicle Detection: The system employs sensors to detect the presence of vehicles in the garage. The FPGA processes the sensor data using VHDL logic to accurately identify and track the cars within the garage and display the count of the number of cars on the FPGA's 7 segment display.

Automated Entry and Exit: Using the detected vehicle information, the Smart Garage System can automatically control garage doors and gates for seamless entry and exit, this is done using an infrared sensor and a servo motor.
